# Parallax-Scrolling-Website-
**This project is a Parallax Scrolling Website cloned from LunDev Code YouTube tutorial for learning purposes. It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing website with smooth scrolling effects, where the background moves at a different speed than the foreground, giving a 3D effect.**

## The goal of this project was to practice:

- Structuring the layout with HTML.
- Styling the page with CSS (including flexbox and grid).
- Implementing smooth scrolling and interactive animations with JavaScript.
- This project is a great example of how parallax effects can be used to enhance user experience and visual design on websites.
